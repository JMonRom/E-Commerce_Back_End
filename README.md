  ## Description

  The task at hand was to build a back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. In order to use Sequelize to interact with a MYSQL Database. I was tasked with configuring a working Express.js API to have a working interaction. Insomnia Core should be used to test the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags.

  Here is a video to the E-Commerce app being run in command line, logging into MYSQL, sourcing schema, seeding data, and testing all required ROUTES:
